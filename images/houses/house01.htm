<p>Urban Sol’s name was inspired by the Mexican theme seen throughout the renovated city bungalow. 
The theme begins at the front entrance, with two large corrugated iron cacti decorating the front doorway, 
and continues with inside.</p>
<p>This is a very social home with a large open plan kitchen, dining and living area. 
The large kitchen has two sets of ovens, sink benches, and fridges. The living area has 
comfortable seating with a DVD and television. Each bedroom in Urban Sol has its own free broadbrand 
Internet connection; some bedrooms have two 
beds and two Internet connections - perfect for friends to share. The house has 
seven spacious bedrooms, two modern bathrooms and two separate toilets.<p>

<p>There is off street parking for up to three cars. With just an eight minute walk to Cathedral Square
and a short walk to local shops, gym, swimming pool, river walks, bars and restaurants this is inner city 
living at its best. </p>
<p>Urban Sol is a favorite Urban Rooms 
house and there is often a waiting list of people wishing to move in as residents often tell their 
friends about the wonderful house in which they live.</p>
